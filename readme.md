I created this repo as a means to learn both python and block chain development. Since I'm more familiar with JavaScript and/or Node development, I followed a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVqczFZr124&feature=youtu.be) about creating a super simple block chain in JS. You can view the equivilant JS code in [this repo](https://github.com/SavjeeTutorials/SavjeeCoin).

I'm built this using:

```bash
$ python --version
Python 2.7.13
```

> BEWARE! running this on Python 3 may result in errors as the syntax for print is different.
